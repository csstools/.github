We're building CSS Tools to enable you to use the newest features of CSS without having to worry about the browsers you're supporting.

We're doing that with [PostCSS][postcss-home] which allows us to create plugins that you can use to transform your CSS code so it's compatible with all browsers âœ¨.

We've created [PostCSS Preset Env][preset-env] which packs all of these plugins together and lets you just configure and forget. 

You can find the CSS features on [cssdb.org][cssdb] which we keep up to date with the state they're, the support they have and some examples and links to get you used to that feature ðŸ¤“.

We're available through these channels:

* [Discord][discord]
* [Discussions][discussions-url]

And if you're curious to know what we're working on or how could you contribute, the [projects](https://github.com/orgs/csstools/projects?type=beta) are always a good first stop!
